			<b> Disclaimer: </b>
			<br>
			In order to receive materials such as variental herbs and quality meats, you need to have completed at least the Charr and Sylvari portion of the <a href = "https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gourmet_Training" target = "_blank" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> Gourmet Training</a> achievement. These materials play a significant role in benchmarks that includes them.

			<b> Node Farm Calculator</b>

			While this farm uses specific Glyphs, check out the <a href = "../gathering.html#calculator" target = "_blank"><u> Node Farm Calcaulator</u></a> to test out the estimated profits with different Glyphs. What are displayed in the benchmarks are not neccessarily the best Glyphs to use for maximum profits.

			<br>
			Start at Orvar's Glen Waypoint [&BMQBAAA=]. This is a great farm to do while waiting for Tequatl. There is a permanent rich Platinum node at Verarium Delves (where the vista is [&BLUBAAA=]) and Shimmerstone Cave ([&BMwBAAA=]). The one in the cave is dangerous because there is a Champion Spider so beware. It could be best to skip it if you don't have a way to get it easily. 

			<br><br>
			The herbs in this map are generally not worth it for the items, but decent for Volatile Magic with Volatile tools.
