			<br>
			In order to receive materials such as variental herbs and quality meats, you need to have completed at least the Charr and Sylvari portion of the <a href = "https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gourmet_Training" target = "_blank" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> Gourmet Training</a> achievement. For this particular benchmark, it is not neccessary nor is it a large portion of the loot. It's just an extra bonus while gathering Jungle Plants. 
			<br><br>
			<b> Spreadsheet</b>
			<br>
			<!--To find averages, specific loots, and more, check out the  <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HOBKHgaPbmc1uMAqupeta824hQzjhiaXBWhPXjORAZs/edit#gid=238669369.html" target = "_blank"><u> spreadsheet</u></a>.-->
			This farm has not yet been recorded for an hour yet. 

			<br><br>
			<b> Node Farm Calculator</b>
			<br>
			While this farm uses specific Glyphs, check out the <a href = "../gathering.html#calculator" target = "_blank"><u> Node Farm Calcaulator</u></a> to test out the estimated profits with different Glyphs. What are displayed in the benchmarks are not neccessarily the best Glyphs to use for maximum profits. 

			<br><br>
			<span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Route:</span>
			<br>
			<b> This may be a somewhat confusing route</b>. Start at Mariner Landing Waypoint [&BL0JAAA=]. From here, head slowly upward on the hill and there will be a couple nodes. As the mini-map changes elevation, there's a choice to either go upward by a bouncing mushroom or through a small valley path. Sometimes there's a Jungle Plant in the valley path, but you could just Skyscale up. 
			<br><br>
			At this point, you're at the middle floor and at the first heart. Head slightly north of the heart and then head east of the heart. Peak a little bit as there will generally be one or two Jungle Plants and other nodes. At some point, head towards the thermal north of the heart (near the middle of the map). 
			<br><br>
			From the thermal, there will be a trail based on the mini-map that is on the edge of the level. Head up through the trail that leads to this POI: [&BMkJAAA=]. From the POI, head south and it will lead to another trail that heads upward. This is a very zigzaggy trail, but keep going up until the area looks more smokey and less jungle. When it does, drift off to the right. You'll reach an edge. From the edge, drop down using Griffon and fly to a platform above the first waypoint.
