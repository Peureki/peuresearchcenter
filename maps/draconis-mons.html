			<h1> Cull the Destroyers </h1>
			<div class = "small-description">
				<p1> There are a total of 13 events in total. For event #1, there are 7 locations throughout the map that can be navigated easily by using thermal tubes. The map above is the route I use that I think works effectively to easily flow a squad to completing as many events as possible. Afterwards, event #2 are destroying 4 champion Destroyers and their burrows. #3 (Destroyer Lieutenants) requires the squad to split into two groups.  </p1>

				<br><br> The Destroyer Lieutenants scale pretty dramatically. With a small group of 5 good dps players, the boss's health can drop quickly. With a large squad of ~20 with average dps, the boss's health drops slowly. 

				<br><br> CCing the Destroyer Lieutenants prevents the platforms from shattering, thus creating more room for boiling water (deals damage over time). Ideally, it would best to CC, but they have a heavy breakbar. Expect the platform to be shattered and to prepare yourself to move as there's going to be less room to fight.

				<br><br> If one Destroyer Lieutenant is defeated before the second is, then the second gets enraged with 200% more damage and takes less damage. It is recommended to kill both Lieutenants relatively around the same time so the second group won't have more of a difficult time. When both Destroyer Lieutenants are defeated, all players participating will receive two bouncy event chests instead of one.
