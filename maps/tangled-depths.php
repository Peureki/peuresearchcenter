				<span style = "font-weight: bold;"> How to: </span>
				<br>
				<p1> Follow the <a href = "#recommendation-events" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> recommended priority of events.</a> This farm is only this profitable when Tangled Depths has the map bonus reward as Shiny Baubles. Otherwise, you can imagine the gold per hour will drop a bit. For this farm, I start around the time a fresh map would start. Unlike other HoT maps, a failed and unprepared meta will result in a fresh map right away. From here, I start right away with outpost events. My order for outpost events goes as the following:

				<br><br>
				- Nuhoch Outpost - First 2 events (making sure the 1st does not bug)
				<br> - Ogre Outpost - All 
				<br> - Rata Outpost - All 
				<br> - SCAR Outpost - All 
				<br> - Nuhoch Outpost - Rest
				<br><br>
				Both Rata and SCAR can change in order. The order is dependent on if other players outside of the squad are doing the events. Most of the time, someone is doing them and progressing them (and that's okay!). Once an outpost is done, I make sure to mark it on my <a href = "../timers/tangled-depths.html" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> timer page.</a> This is to start all the event spawn timers since they only start when you finish an outpost. From there, it's just event after event after event. It will be a non-stop event train until the meta (the timer page will go crazy!). This benchmark does include doing the meta.
