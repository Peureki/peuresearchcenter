				<p1>
					Desolation isn't the most obvious in terms of how to farm it. Most of the events are considered not worth doing, but luckily there are a lot of Forged events. As with other PoF maps, Forged champions give Forged Battered Components which are the champion bags that offer multiple Unidentified Gear, recipies, and Forged skins that may be worth a pretty penny. In this farm, I mainly focused on Raiding Parties, the metas, and an occasional legendary bounty or event if stuff is on cooldown. 
					<br><br>
					<span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Method: </span> 
					<br>
					Using my <a href = "../timers/desolation.html" style = "text-decoration: underline"> timer page</a>, I farmed events on the west side of the map mainly. This includes events such as: 5 of the Raiding Party, Redeemer Kossan, and the Maw of Torment meta. Due to their low cooldowns, it's possile to rotation between these events without having to need to go to the other parts of the map until the Junundu Rising meta.
					<br><br>
					I started my farm at the same hour as when Maw would begin. Though, while the meta was in progress, our squad did not participate in the first event. I figured I'd get more chances for champions and currency if I were to farm the Raiding Parties and Redeemer Kossan. Before the 1st Maw event ended (about 2-3 minutes left), I would quickly run through all the locations of the next Maw events and split the squad up into 3 groups. These events as simple escorts so there were at least 5+ people at each escort. After the escorts were completed, we killed the Legendary Forged boss and killed additional champions that may have spawned.  
					<br><br>
					<span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Disclaimer: </span> 
					<br>
					After Maw, I would do another round of the Raiding Parties and Redeemer Kossan. If I had extra time before Junundu, I would do the legendary bounty: Awakened Hoarder. While he is not a Forged, it's possible for it to drop a unique mini, Mini Awakened Abomination. For Junundu, when the fort champions spawn, I go from Awakened to Forged. Generally, not many champions spawn on the Forged fort. It's possible the Awakened Fort may be better with a squad because of the amount of champions that spawn, but Forged fort is also much harder to defeat without a squad. With the squad killing the Forged first, the Awakened is usually done the same time and compeleting the meta quick. 
					<br><br>
					With the last 20ish minutes left to complete an hour of farming, I continued to do more Raiding Parties and Redeemer Kossan. I've also touched a little bit of the Ghost Kids (Meymo and Kyrisah event), Champion Ooze, and Ghost Eaters if there's nothing else up.

				There are 3 phases to this meta: 
				<br> 1) Attacking elite Forged officers and cannons
				<br> 2) Escorting 3 NPCs from the NW, N, and SE sections of the Maw area to the center
				<br> 3) Defeating the legendary Forged Demolisher 
				<br><br>
				<span style = "font-weight: bold;">1) </span>
				<br>
				There are 3 individual events (left picture). While there is a time limit (8 minutes), this event can actually fail and the meta will still progress. The event is all about destroying the Forged elites and cannons. The elites and cannons will persist to the next event if none are destroyed, which will make it slightly more difficult for smaller groups. 
				<br><br>
				It is possible for each of these events to upscale to champion Forged. A method that can work is to only do one or two lanes (or three if your group is really fast) individually to obtain the most amount of champs. The more the squad does, the more the prep beforehand since it will be more difficult to spread when the timer runs out. 
				<br><br>
				<span style = "font-weight: bold;">2) </span>
				<br>
				There are 3 escorts that need to be carried out within 8 minutes. Each spawns at the start of the previous event (right picture). Disclaimer, this part of the event is known to bug out by stalling. Each of these escorts need at least a small group to succeed as there are a lot of Forged enemies. I recommend at least 5 for each escort, but the more the better. 
				<br><br>
				Each of the escorts can upscale to champions. While it may sound great to do an escort at a time (they are quick), the time it takes to travel to other escorts and to complete them may not be enough time to do each individually. It's most likey best to complete all 3 as fast as possible. 
				<br><br>
				<span style = "font-weight: bold;">3) </span>
				<br>
				Afterwards, a legendary Forged boss will spawn at the waypoint, The Darklands Waypoint [&BKMKAAA=]. The basic mechanics of this boss is to avoid its dash attack that leaves a firey trail and to attack where it isn't putting a shield up. 
				<br><br>
				Occasionally, Forged champions will spawn throughout the fight. They do drop loot so make sure to tag those!

				<br><br>
				<span style = "font-weight: bold;">1) </span>

The common route is to start with the Awakened champion then to the Forged. <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Disclaimer: </span> make sure to not stand on top of the champions as they will teleport away and possibly go invulnerable if they go past the fort barrier. 
				<br><br>
				After the champions, the junundu wurms will have taken down the barriers of the gate and there are 3 trebs/cannons to defeat in both camps. More champions are likey to spawn at the Awakened than the Forged, but generally people split to both forts to finish them quickly. They downscale pretty well with a small group.
