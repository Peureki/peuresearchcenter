			<h class = "bookmark-header" style = "background-color: rgb(156, 235, 255);"> Amalgamated & Key Metas </h>
			<br><br>
			As the title says, this farm is about Amalgamated Gemstones and Keys in PoF, LS4, and LS5 maps. This farm is difficult to do without a somewhat organized group and above average DPS. There are lots of quick map swapping and traveling in order to get to other metas in time. Here's the rundown:

			<br><br>
			- Crystal Oasis: Choya Pinata
			<br> - Desolation: Junundu Wurms
			<br> - Grothmar: Doomlore Shrine
			<br> - Thunderhead Peaks: Oil Floes
			<br> - Domain of Vabbi: Forged with Fire
			<br> - Grothmar: Ooze Pit

			<br><br>
			The hardest part about this farm is that each meta needs to be completed on-time or a minute after the next meta. For example, Junundu Wurms overlaps with Doomlore by a minute or two (depending on the DPS), but the escort and meta should still be up. Same with Oil Floes, but that also requires some organization to have everyone split into the three drills.
		</div>

		<div id = "core-tyria-farm" class = "small-description">
			<h class = "bookmark-header" style = "background-color: rgb(255, 97, 41);"> Core Tyria Farm </h>
			<br><br>
			This farm is unique as it could change depending on what the weekly map bonus rewards are for particular maps. This farm is harder to test as core tyrian maps have an 8 week rotation. Here are great maps to do with great map bonus rewards:

			<br>
			<br> Cursed Shore - Week 4, 5, 8

			<br><br>
			Here are maps that *might* be good, but needs testing: 
			<br> Kessex Hills - Week 2
			<br> Malchor's Leap - Week 4

			<br><br>
			The <b> general rotation </b> is: 
			<br> 1) Start at xx:00 with Karka Queen
			<br> 2) xx:03 - xx:18: Cursed Shore events
			<br> 3) xx:20 - xx:22: Ley Line Anomoly 
			<br> 4) xx:22 - xx:28: Silverwastes Chest Train 
			<br> 5) xx:30 - xx:36: Awakened (Joko) Invasion
			<br> 6) xx:36 - ??:??: Silverwastes (either finishing a map or finding a fresh map for RIBA) 

			<br><br>
			When the train enters Cursed Shore, it all depends on what is up and what is not. For the last few trials, we've gotten at least 1 meta up (temple, Arah, or Penitent). Since we're only there for 15 minutes, it fills the time slot perfectly. The goal is to tag as many mobs as possible and to get a few events in for the map bonus award. Generally, the map bonus is some T6 mat, but <a href = "https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Map_bonus_reward/profit" target = "_blank"><u>check what they are for each week.</u></a> 
		</div>

		<div id = "grothmar-bjora" class = "small-description">
			<h class = "bookmark-header" style = "background-color: rgb(156, 235, 255);"> Grothmar/Bjora Marches </h>
			<br>
			<br>
			This farm splits into Grothmar and Bjora constantly. It starts with Grothmar's meta and ends with Grothmar's meta, but in between has Bjora events. The basic rundown goes as following:

			<br><br>
			- Grothmar: Effigy Meta
			<br>- Kourna events
			<br>- Grothmar: Doomlore Meta
			<br>- Kourna events
			<br>- Grothmar: Ooze Pit Meta

			<br><br>
			For every Grothmar meta, there is about a 40 minute timer. But, both Doomlore and Ooze Pit are able to begin before the 40 minutes. For example, Effigy could begin at :10 and Doomlore could begin at :35. For Doomlore, there will be an NPC ready at [&BAUMAAA=]. For Ooze, check the [&BPgLAAA=] waypoint to see if it is up.

			<br><br>
			For Bjora, I do a clockwise rotation from Jora's Keep Waypoint [&BCcMAAA=] throughout the eastern section of the map. There are a total of 6 champions and 3 raiding parties with generally low cooldown. Though, every event has a fail timer the moment they spawn so it's a gamble what events will be up by the time you arrive. Use the <a href = "../timers/bjora-marches.html"><u>timer page</u></a> to determine the respawn rate.

		<div id = "grothmark-kourna" class = "small-description">
			<h class = "bookmark-header" style = "background-color: rgb(156, 235, 255);"> Grothmar/Domain of Kourna </h>
			<br><br>
			This farm splits into Grothmar and Kourna constantly. It starts with Grothmar's meta and ends with Grothmar's meta, but in between has Kourna events and potentially that meta. The basic rundown goes as following:

			<br><br>
			- Grothmar: Effigy Meta
			<br>- Kourna events
			<br>- Grothmar: Doomlore Meta
			<br>- Kourna events
			<br>- Grothmar: Ooze Pit Meta

			<br><br>
			For every Grothmar meta, there is about a 40 minute timer. But, both Doomlore and Ooze Pit are able to begin before the 40 minutes. For example, Effigy could begin at :10 and Doomlore could begin at :35. For Doomlore, there will be an NPC ready at [&BAUMAAA=]. For Ooze, check the [&BPgLAAA=] waypoint to see if it is up.

			<br><br>
			For Kourna events, the priority goes as follows: 
			<br> 1) Researcher Emm
			<br> 2) Cannons (not meta pre-event)
			<br> 3) Champion Shark 
			<br> 4) Choya Chieftain 
			<br> 5) Meta 
			<br> 6) Researcher Maggin

			<br><br> 
			It sounds a little unusual to have a meta event as low priorty, but unfortunately, the Kourna meta really is lacking in terms of loots. None of the mobs drop any loot for both the pre-event cannons and the meta itself. In addition, the boss is very dull, boring, and tanky. 

			<br><br>
			Thus, other events take priority over the meta in order to max out loots and Volatile Magic. They all have a relatively low cooldown. For more information of the events, check out the <a href = "../maps/domain-of-kourna.html"><u>map info page</u></a> and follow the event respawn rates at <a href = "../timers/domain-of-kourna.html"><u> the timer page </u></a>.

		<div id = "hot-meta-train" class = "small-description">
			<h class = "bookmark-header" style = "background-color: rgb(19, 201, 54);"> HoT Meta Train </h>
			<br><br>
			While this says "HoT", I do not go to Dragon's Stand. The reason is because Dragon's Stand is long and not an easy way to get loot. This farm goes as following:

			<br><br>
			- Verdant Brink: 1 Boss (Matriarch or Axemaster)
			<br> - Tangled Depths: Events and meta
			<br> - Auric Basin: Events and meta
		</div>

		<div id = "infusion-train" class = "small-description">
			<h class = "bookmark-header" style = "background-color: rgb(19, 201, 54);"> Infusion Train [SM]</h>
			<br><br>
			This train is done by the guild Shiny Mayhem [SM] with cjosh.4598 and Noir.1652. The train starts and begins at XX:05, at reset. The route goes as following:

			<br><br>
			- Casino Blitz / Pinata
			<br> - Tangled Depths: Meta
			<br> - Desolation: Legendary Awakened Hoarder
			<br> - Auric Basin: Meta
			<br> - Jahai Bluffs: Death-Branded Shatterer
			<br> - Desolation: Legendary Awakened Hoarder, Legendary Queen Ishraa
			<br> - Desolation: Junundu Wurms
		</div>

		<!-- LS3 meta train -->
		<div id = "ls3-train" class = "small-description">
			<h class = "bookmark-header" style = "background-color: rgb(19, 201, 54);"> LS3 Meta Train </h>
			<br><br>
			This farm is specifically aimed to hit as many events/metas as possible, in a given amount of time vs. doing every single event for achievements (Aurora). The limit I put myself is 2 hours because anything longer, the event train drags and some events are very slow. 

			<br><br>
			<b> The general rotation</b> goes as the following:
			<br> - xx:30 (right before Dusk/Night): Bitterfrost Events/Chest Train
			<br> - xx:45 (Night): Bloodstone Fen Spirits Meta/Events/Hablion/Maw (if its up)
			<br> - 1:05: Lake Doric Leather Farm
			<br> - 1:28: Lake Doric Noran's Homestead Meta
			<br> - 1:36: Draconis Mons Destroyers Meta
			<br> - 1:45: Ember Bay Events
			<br> - 2:00: Draconis Mons Destroyer Meta
			<br> - 2:10: Siren's Landing Meta/Events/Chest Train

			<br><br>
			This is the ideal rotation. Each time we do this train, it changes by either extending a map or the opposite. 

			<br><br>
			<b> Bitterfrost </b>
			<br>
			We start here because if there's ever extra time to go back, the Icebound Chests would be back to gather again. Since we're only here for about 15 minutes, there's a good chance the group may not hit the meta. If it does, then great. The main point of this map is to gather the Icebound Chests and complete a few events along the way. Events could be defending a Brazier, lighting up a Brazier, or doing either the Griffon defense or Svanir chain. 

			<div class = "page-picture">
				<img src = "../images/ls3-train/bitterfrost-1.jpg">
			</div>

			<br><br>
			<b> Bloodstone Fen </b>
			<br>
			At xx:45, Tyria turns night. This means that the Spirits meta will be up on the ground level. This meta has a pre-event where you have to kill spirits all over the ground level, but it can be heavily upscaled with a squad. In the meantime, there are 3 repeatable events that spawn one after the other (White Mantle Seekers). Do this in a clockwise rotation to get extra loot and champions. Along the way could be a Treasure Mushroom as well. If either the Maw meta or Hablion is up, do that instead. 

			<div class = "page-picture">
				<img src = "../images/ls3-train/bloodstone-1.jpg">
			</div>

			<br><br>
			<b> Lake Doric </b>
			<br>
			This part of the train depends how long Bloodstone Fen's events went. If the Maw meta never occured, then the squad should arrive here on time around 1:05. If so, then there's time to do one round of the leather farm. If the train is later than 1:15, it's best to do Lake Doric events instead. The best to past the time are Jade Cannons or Skrimishes. 

			<br><br>
			No matter what route the squad takes, at xx:28, Noran's Homested will start. If the squad did the leather farm prior, then they can move on to the new map. If not, then do one round of the leather farm. 

			<div class = "page-picture">
				<img src = "../images/lake-doric/leather-farm.jpg" style = "width: 40%;">
				<img src = "../images/ls3-train/lake-doric-1.jpg" style = "width: 40%;">
			</div>

			<br><br>
			<b> Draconis Mons </b>
			<br>
			When entering the map, the main goal is to check the status of the meta. If the meta is not displaying on the side, then the squad should stay in the map and do other events until it spawns. If the meta is already progressed, then do the meta right away (whatever progress it is). Ideally, you want to do the pre-event where you kill wave of Destroyers over and over again to spawn champs. If you get to a map that already has their meta progressed and you finished it, go to the next map. If the meta was near completion before you got there, plan to head back ~16 minutes to get the pre-meta events.

		<div id = "ls4-train" class = "small-description">
			<h class = "bookmark-header" style = "background-color: rgb(255, 47, 103);"> LS4 Meta Train </h>
			<br><br>
			This farm is generally hosted by Guild MM Trading Company [TP], Overflow Trading Company [OTC], This Guild Ruined My [Life], and End Game [CREW]. The train is run extremely frequently during almost the entire day from afternoon to very late night. I highly recommend joining the Overflow <a href = "https://discord.gg/7tWwz499rX" target = "_blank"><u>discord</u></a> for pings and notices on when they are going to run their train!

			<br>
			Each guild has their own preference to what the route is, but here's the general idea/plan: 
			<br><br><b> Domain of Istan </b>
			<br> Palawadan meta (xx:45) &#8594; events until Great Hall meta (xx:20) &#8594; possibly repeat events until Thunderhead Meta at xx:45
			<br> Events include: Akali, Pirate event chain, Legendary Smoldge bounty, Graveyard

			<br><br><b> Thunderhead Peaks (1/2)</b>
			<br> Oil Floes (xx:45)

			<br><br><b> Jahai Bluffs </b>
			<br> DERV Escort (xx:00) &#8594; Death-Branded Shatterer (~xx:15) &#8594; Incursions, Ziya (Djinn Escort) until next Thunderhead Meta at xx:45

			<br><br><b> Thunderhead Peaks (2/2)</b>
			<br> Thunderhead Keep (xx:45)

			<br><br><b> Sandswept Isles </b>
			<br> Ideal plan: South meta &#8594; North meta
			<br> Unlike the other LS4 maps, these metas are timed based on their instanced rather than a global timer. Depending on the progress of the map will deteremine the next steps for the train. In general, North meta is difficult to solo/small groups so it's rarely done and is able to pause its progress. The South meta is on a 40 minute cooldown from its last run, but a 15 minute timer will appear on the side if you're in the area. 

			<br><br>
			If there is some time between North and South, doing the Dominus Crystallium, Mark III Golem, or Beetle Queen are good fillers. If not, there are also easy champion bounties, with north ones being easier.

		<div id = "pof-meta-train" class = "small-description">
			<h class = "bookmark-header" style = "background-color: rgb(255, 47, 103);"> PoF Meta Train </h>
			<br><br>
			This farm goes through all PoF maps except Desert Highlands. Besides me, the other commander that runs this train is darkphoenix.3740. The route as following:

			<br><br>
			- Elon Riverlands: Path of Ascension → Events in between → Doppleganger
			<br> - Domain of Vabbi: Forged with Fire
			<br> - Crystal Oasis: Casino Blitz / Pinata
			<br> - Desolation: Legendary bounties → events → Junundu Wurms
		</div>

		<div id = "reset" class = "small-description">
			<h class = "bookmark-header" style = "background-color: rgb(255, 97, 41);"> Reset Train </h>
			<br><br>
			This farm is about bouncing meta to meta after reset. Due to Daylight Savings, this may be placed on a different hour than reset. I heard there's a commander that does this and I'll have to record their train one of these days to replace this one. My route goes as following:

			<br><br>
			- Domain of Vabbi: Forged with Fire
			<br>- Grothmar Valley: Effigy
			<br>- Core: Ley-line Anomaly
			<br>- Verdant Brink: Frogs → Airship Cargo nearby
			<br>- Grothmar Valley: Doomlore Shrine
			<br>- Thunderhead: Oil Floes
		</div>

		<div id = "thunderhead-kourna" class = "small-description">
			<h class = "bookmark-header" style = "background-color: rgb(255, 47, 103);"> Thunderhead Peaks/Domain of Kourna </h>
			<br><br>
			This farm starts with Thunderhead and still ends with Thunderhead. In between each meta, do Kourna events since Thunderhead does not provide good events to farm. 

			<br><br>
			Each Thunderhead meta starts at the xx:45 of the hour, alternativing north or south for every hour. Depending on when you do the train, you could start at north meta or south meta. Each meta will take about 15-20 minutes to complete, leaving about 45 minutes to do Kourna events.

			<br><br>
			In those 45 minutes, the priority in Kouna goes as follows: 
			<br> 1) Researcher Emm
			<br> 2) Cannons (not meta pre-event)
			<br> 3) Champion Shark 
			<br> 4) Choya Chieftain 
			<br> 5) Meta 
			<br> 6) Researcher Maggin

			<br><br> 
			It sounds a little unusual to have a meta event as low priorty, but unfortunately, the Kourna meta really is lacking in terms of loots. None of the mobs drop any loot for both the pre-event cannons and the meta itself. In addition, the boss is very dull, boring, and tanky.

		<div id = "sandswept-kourna" class = "small-description">
			<h class = "bookmark-header" style = "background-color: rgb(255, 47, 103);"> Sandswept Isles/Domain of Kourna </h>
			<br><br>
			This farm starts with Sandswept and ends with Kourna. The reason is because the metas (2) in Sandswept are extremely profitable and has the potential to do both back-to-back. Kourna is involved because, to fill an hour worth of time, Kourna is a great filler to quick events that does not involve anything strict. Ideally, the farm would go something like this: 


			<br><br>
			1) Sandswept: Specimen Chamber meta
			<br>2) Sandswept: Dominus Crystallum
			<br>3) Sandswept: Gathering Storms meta
			<br>4) Kourna events

			<br><br>
			As the commander, it is possible to prep the train. By going to the map about 30 minutes to an hour early, parking a character to check on the activity of both metas is good to keep track of each. Use <a href = "../timers/sandswept-isles.html"><u> Sandswept timer page</u></a> to figure out the respawn time of each meta if you happen to see it complete or fail. 

			<br><br>
			For Kourna events, the priority goes as follows: 
			<br> 1) Researcher Emm
			<br> 2) Cannons (not meta pre-event)
			<br> 3) Champion Shark 
			<br> 4) Choya Chieftain 
			<br> 5) Meta 
			<br> 6) Researcher Maggin

			<br><br> 
			It sounds a little unusual to have a meta event as low priorty, but unfortunately, the Kourna meta really is lacking in terms of loots. None of the mobs drop any loot for both the pre-event cannons and the meta itself. In addition, the boss is very dull, boring, and tanky.
