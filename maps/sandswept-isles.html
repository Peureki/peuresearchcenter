			<h2> How to: </h2>
			<div class = "small-description">
				<p1> Follow the <a href = "#recommendation-events"> recommended priority of events.</a> Ideally, the events should be in order to get the most amount of gold, but sometimes that's not the case. Follow the list as close as possible to get most of your time's worth. Use your best judgement to which event should be done next. Also, consider the distance between the current event and the next event and jduge if it's worth the time to travel or not.</p1>

				<p1> <br><br> If you're the commander, make sure to communicate with the squad on where you're going to and have a relatively steady pace so most can still follow easily. </p1>

				<p1> <br><br> Have a build that can provide decent DPS (so the event champs/bosses don't take a long time), can provide good mobility, and good AoEs to tag multiple mobs. Check some farming builds here: <br><a href = "https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World" target = "_blank"> Meta Battle Open World Builds </a></p1>

				<p1> The first event has players attack waves of Inquests for 7 minute in this enclosed area. Waves spawn when every single mob from a wave gets defeated. It is possible for multiple waves to spawn at once. 

				<br><br> Waves spawns from the left, right, and inside the defense zone. 

				<br><br> From my personal experience, waiting for the mobs to run towards the defense zone decreases the total number of potential mobs that spawn overall. This is due to too much waiting for the mobs to run + you can't contol people who have range that will kill mobs before they reach. 

				<br><br> The best way is to make sure you have AoEs, some range, or speed to constantly run to each wave to tag mobs. I do not recommend major/raid DPS on the mobs as they are not ranked any speciality (just normal, not veterans or elites).

			Start at Atholma Waypoint [&BEMLAAA=]. Northeast of the waypoint has a quick plant farm. Most of the plants are not worth much, but can bring a lot of Volatile Magic with Volatile tools. The entire zone (except in areas with Inquest) are filled with nodes, including the water. A high amount of profits will be from: 
			<br> - Difluorite (before it caps)
			<br> - Coral 
			<br> - Mussels (rare chance to get a Freshwater Pearl, but the node is abundant here)
