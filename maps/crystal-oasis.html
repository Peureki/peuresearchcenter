					Before starting, this farm requires <b>at least 20 people</b> to scale for champions. As with most map farms, it will not work with solo or small groups. If there's no Forged Champions, there's no <img src = "../images/assets/containers/Battered_Forged_Components.png" style = "width: 25px; height: 25px; vertical-align: middle;"> Battered Forged Components which are the main profits for this specific farm. 

					<br><br>
					Crystal Oasis as a whole is a fantatic map with many different dynamic events. Out of all the PoF maps, it has the most Forged events. These events are the secret to this farm as they provide Forged champions. These champions provide  <img src = "../images/assets/containers/Battered_Forged_Components.png" style = "width: 25px; height: 25px; vertical-align: middle;"> Battered Forged Components which are champion bags that provide multiple pieces of green+ Unidentified Gear and a chance to drop recipies and skins that potentially could be worth a couple gold. 
					<br><br>
					<span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Method: </span> 
					<br>
					Using my <a href = "../timers/crystal-oasis.html" style = "text-decoration: underline"> timer page</a>, I farmed events on the west side of the map mainly. This includes events such as: 4 of the Raiding Party (north/south), Refugee (south), and the Farm. Due to their low cooldowns, it's possile to rotation between these events without having to need to go to the other parts of the map. To get the best results, it's possile to sit at the spawn location at each of the Raiding Party events before they spawn so they can upscale right away. This makes it easier to spawn more than 1 champion. The Raiding Party events spawn at each gate of the Forged camps. 
					<br><br>
					I generally start my farm an hour before Pinata. I include Pinata because the Choya Pinata is valuable in the sense that it drops 3 guaranteed rare Unidentified Gear, Amalgamated Gemstone, and a chance to drop the Confetti Infusion (and it's awkward not to do it). During the first/second rounds of Casino Blitz, I tell the squad to grab a few coins. For each round, we do the bounties Zelke and Legendary Choya. There's also many caches layed out through the cities so I try to place markers on their <a href = "../gathering/amnoon-node-cache-farm.html" target = "_blank"><u>locations</u></a>.  
					<br><br>
					<span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Disclaimer: </span> 
					<br>
					For me, I did take bounty requests. If I did, I would try to include them in my rotation (do them if they are nearby the next event). Obviously this took a slight hit in the gold per hour, but I think it's realistic to put it in the benchmark because there are a lot of bounties required for collections and achievements. There's always going to be a request for something or two, espcically Facet. If it's Facet, I do it at the end because it's out of the way.

				Probably one of the more simplier metas. Unlike most, this requires some participation by gathering floating Casino Coins that are scattered throughout Amnoon. For max effenciency to gather them all, check out <a href = "http://tekkitsworkshop.net/index.php/path-of-fire/147-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-casino-blitz-coin-run-with-custom-taco-routes" target = "_blank" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> Tekkit's Workshop guide</a>. 
				<br><br>
				There are 3 rounds for players to collect at least 150 Casino Coins. After 3 successful rounds, a Choya Pinata will spawn. Catch it before it escapes! It is possible to fail one round to spawn the Choya Pinata, but there still needs to be 3 successful runs. If a round fails, then that round repeats again. 
				<br><br>
				The Choya Pinata offers a Crystal Oasis Hero's Chest that grants 3 guaranteed rare Unidentified Gear, a choice of either: 
				<br>
				- Amalgamated Gemstone
				<br> - Pulsing Brandsparks (2)
				<br> - Intact Mosaic 
				<br> - Pile of Elonian Trade Contracts (100)
				<br> - Recipe: Zehtuka's Harrier Inscription
				<br><br>
