			<p1> <span style = "font-weight: bold;">How to:</span>
			<br>
			Follow the <a href = "#recommendation-events" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> recommended priority of events.</a> This farm is kind of RNG, depending on whether or not the Bloodstone Maw meta is up. Because this meta is not on a global timer, the only way to predict when this event will be up is knowing when it last ended. Otherwise, when starting this farm, you can assume that it will spawn sometime within the hour (since it has a 1 hour cooldown). 

			<br><br>
			In general, I tend to start my farm around the time the Night Meta spawns (Spirits). While the first event takes a long time due to scaling, I rotate the squad with all the seeker/cleric events. Once the first meta event is complete, then we focus on the champions/final escort. If the Bloodstone Maw did start, we ditch and head there instead. Not ideal, but it happens. 
			<br><br>
			If both Bloodstone Maw isn't up or Spirits, then I focus on the seeker/cleric events as they can scale to champions and finish quickly. If Hablion is up, we do that once for the daily chest. For a chance of pace, we do the Fragmented Wastes events if a rift appeared on the ground or is nearby the Hablion event. I generally avoid doing them because the squad has a harder time catching up from all the gliding/mounting constantly.  </p1>

			<p1> Meta has a respawn rate of 1 hour, but it is tied to the instance of a map rather than a global timer. When the meta starts, a message will broadcast in the game saying "Jade Constructs are teleporting into Bloodstone Maw". </p1>

			<br><br> There are only 3 phases to this meta. For each event, there is a time limit so make sure to try your best to complete as fast as possible.

			<br><br><span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Phase 1: </span><br> This phase repeats 4 times. Destroying either a Champion Jade Armor or Jade Bow. Jade Armors mainly deal melee damage, knockbacks, and stuns while Jade Bows mainly deal projectile damage. For Jade Armors, it's best to be wary of telegraph skills and avoid melee range when it's spinning. They also have more defense and die slower than Jade Bows. Both Jade champions will have a CC phase around 75%. Make sure to CC during this phase to deal damage. 

			<br><br><span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Phase 2: </span><br> Similar to Phase 1, but you'll have to kill two Champion Jades (one each). All players should gather close and destroy the Jade Bow first because 1) it will cause the Jade Armor to move closer so players can cleave and 2) Jade Bows die faster. 

			<br><br><span style = "font-weight: bold;"> Phase 3: </span><br> If you've ever done Vale Guardian in the raid Wing 1, then it's the same boss. Except, the green circles don't wipe a group. Instead, the green circle provides a special action key that will enhance your damage by 200%. Blue circles teleport you randomly and red circles deal large damages over time. The boss will likely choose a sole person to tank so make sure everyone stays close so he does not move as much!
