				<p1> Follow the <a href = "#recommendation-events" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> recommended priority of events.</a> In general, this map does not have many events that are squad friendly. There are a lot, but they are either very short escorts, small waves of events, or far apart. But, with a good DPS squad, there are a lot of bounties available to do that are generally easy..except the bounty board in the northwest. Don't do that unless you want to troll your squad (they're evil, espically the rabbit). For this benchmark, I did not include the meta.
