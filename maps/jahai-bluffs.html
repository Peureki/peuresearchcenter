				<p1> Follow the <a href = "#recommendation-events"> recommended priority of events.</a> Ideally, the events should be in order to get the most amount of gold, but sometimes that's not the case. Follow the list as close as possible to get most of your time's worth. Use your best judgement to which event should be done next. Also, consider the distance between the current event and the next event and jduge if it's worth the time to travel or not.</p1>

				<p1> <br><br> If you're the commander, make sure to communicate with the squad on where you're going to and have a relatively steady pace so most can still follow easily. </p1>

				<p1> <br><br> Have a build that can provide decent DPS (so the event champs/bosses don't take a long time), can provide good mobility, and good AoEs to tag multiple mobs.

				<p1> This Shatterer is similar to the OG Shatterer in Blazeridge. The general consensus is to fight on one side (right) so everyone is grouped together. Watch out for pulsing AoEs and stomps.

				<br><br> At 50% of the boss's total health, there will be two Riftstalkers. One on the left and right of the boss's feet. Since the squad is already attacking the right feet, turn out and fight the Riftstalker. Then, head to the other
