			<div class = "small-description">
				<p1> Follow the <a href = "#recommendation-events"> recommended priority of events.</a> Ideally, the events should be in order to get the most amount of gold, but sometimes that's not the case. Follow the list as close as possible to get most of your time's worth. Use your best judgement to which event should be done next. Also, consider the distance between the current event and the next event and jduge if it's worth the time to travel or not.</p1>

				<p1> <br><br> If you're the commander, make sure to communicate with the squad on where you're going to and have a relatively steady pace so most can still follow easily. </p1>

				<p1> <br><br> Have a build that can provide decent DPS (so the event champs/bosses don't take a long time), can provide good mobility, and good AoEs to tag multiple mobs.

				<br><br> When the defense phase starts, a strat is to defend one side so that the zerg can achieve the most loot while still protecting the center. With that said, the zerg can also defeat one champion Riftstalker at a time for bonus loot. 

				<br><br> The final boss has a defense shield that needs to taken down by going back to the Gear symbol and picking up Dragonblood Spears. Use your special skill to attack the boss to decrease the defense shield to make it vulnerable. From there, watch out for telegraph skills
