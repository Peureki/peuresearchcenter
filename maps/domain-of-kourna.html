			<b> How to: </b>
			<br>
			<p1> Follow the <a href = "#recommendation-events"> recommended priority of events.</a> Ideally, the events should be in order to get the most amount of gold, but sometimes that's not the case. Follow the list as close as possible to get most of your time's worth. Use your best judgement to which event should be done next. Also, consider the distance between the current event and the next event and jduge if it's worth the time to travel or not.</p1>

			<p1> <br><br> If you're the commander, make sure to communicate with the squad on where you're going to and have a relatively steady pace so most can still follow easily. </p1>

			<p1> <br><br> Have a build that can provide decent DPS (so the event champs/bosses don't take a long time), can provide good mobility, and good AoEs to tag multiple mobs. Check some farming builds here: <br><a href = "https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World" target = "_blank"> Meta Battle Open World Builds </a></p1>

				<p1> This is a very quick meta and somewhat awkward with a large zerg. For example, event #1 are 3 Pylons that spawn at the same time. These Pylons do not scale and have a fixed HP (not a lot). Make sure to attack it once if you have a large zerg so everyone has a chance for credit.

				<br><br> The arrows are my personal routes for the Pylons. Any way works, I just prefer this way because it's close to the NPC where you can turn in the spare parts + close event #2

				<br><br> Once #1 has been completed and all the spare parts are collected, event #2 happens in all 3 locations. Instead of attacking the cannon, you have to defend it. None of the mobs drop exp or loot. The southeast location starts 20 seconds faster than the others.  </p1>

			For all Solo Farms, is it worth noting a few things:
			<br> 1. It's <b>require at least tier 1 of the Karmic Empowerment</b> (obtained via Volatile Magic vendor). The reason is because it forces each mob to drop 1 Karmic Retribution, thus also forcing the mob to drop Volatile Magic.

			<br><br> 2. Diminishing returns starts at around 30 minutes, depending on how quickly you kill the mobs. If you start noticing that you are not obtaining any volatile magic from a mob, switch characters to refresh the farm.
