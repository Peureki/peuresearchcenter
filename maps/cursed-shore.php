				<br>
				<p1> Follow the <a href = "#recommendation-events" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> recommended priority of events.</a> This farm is only during the week 4 of the <a href = "https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Map_bonus_reward/profit" target = "_blank" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> map bonus rotation. </a> Essentially this farm was about tagging events that spawns either a lot of mobs or champions. Both temple and Arah metas were included, but it is also hard to predict when they will spawn. I believe they have about a 2 hour cooldown, but since this farm was recorded 1.5 hours, it's safe to say that there's a chance that 1 or 2 of the meta events may not show up. 
				<br><br>
				Interestingly enough, one of the hardest parts about this farm was that DPS is generally very high compared to what this farm used to be in 2012-2014. With that said, mobs die very very quickly so it's best to notify the squad to bring loot sticks rather than their raid builds.
