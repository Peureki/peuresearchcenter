				<p1> Follow the <a href = "#recommendation-events" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> recommended priority of events.</a> Unfortunately, Grothmar does not have many events for farming. The map in general is more of a permanent festival map with mini metas. Luckily, the metas are worth wild, but they are sort and spawn around 30-40 from each other. In this farm, I forced myself to do it for 2 hours to hit every meta and event.
