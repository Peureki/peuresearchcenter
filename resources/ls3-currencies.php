					<br> Once per day, you can enter a home instance (preferably that has most/all nodes) to guarantee the currencies. Most nodes offer 3 while some offer a little bit more. If you have the Season 3 Expedition Contract for your home instance, you can get a couple more currencies per day.

			<br><br>
			1) Heart at [&BFwJAAA=]

			<br><br>
			3) Heart at [&BFUJAAA=]
			<br>
			There are a lot of Destroyers here. I recommend killing the Destroyers and interacting with the Weapon Crates. If the Fissure event (north of the WP) is up, I recommend doing it as it will have a lot of mobs around it.

			<br>
			In total, there are 4 hearts, and I recommend doing all of them as they are quick, easy (but maybe slightly annoying). Each heart grants <span style = "font-weight: bold"> 5 Fresh Winterberries </span>.
			<br><br>
			1) Heart at [&BIkJAAA=]
			<br>
			There are Dragonbanners that will finish the heart quickly, but you will have to clear some mobs. In the right picture, make sure to have these 3 pieces in your inventory by killing Svanir: Head piece, chest piece, and leggings. Double click these to transform your character in order to access the area of the heart vendor.

			</div>
			
			2) Heart at [&BIgJAAA=] (more NE)
			<br>
			The quickest way to complete this heart is to run around near the heart vendor to collect Abandoned Griffon Eggs. Take these to an Incubator besides the heart NPC. Repeat this process until the heart completes.

			3) Heart at [&BI8JAAA=] & [&BH8JAAA=]
			<br>
			Next to where the Fresh Winterberry nodes are, there are interactable ice crystals. Click on them to destroy them and they will complete the heart quickly. To finish the heart if there's more process needed, kill any nearby Icebrood as I'm sure you'll be attacked. 
			<div class = "map-image-box" style = "display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
				<img class = "map-image" style = "width: 50%;" src = "../images/bitterfrost-frontier/heart-5.jpg">

			4) Heart at [&BH4JAAA=]
			<br>
			Throughout the area, there are nodes called Savory Herbs. Collect them and turn them in to the NPC. 
			<div class = "map-image-box" style = "display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
				<img class = "map-image" style = "width: 40%;" src = "../images/bitterfrost-frontier/heart-6.jpg">

			<br>

			Out of all the other LS3 maps, the nodes are abundant and all nearby. Check out my picture below for my route or Tekkit's route. Icebound Chests also have a chance to recieve <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> 1 Fresh Winterberry. </span>. The second picture is the area of where the Icebound Chests are, but I highly recommend doing just the nodes if you're looking for mostly Winterberries. To unlock the chests, you need to grab a torch from a lit Brazier that does not have an event active and have the mastery "Koda's Flame" from Ancient Magics mastery line.

			There are 3 metas in this map. Each will give daily currency per character per day. Lake Doric is unique where, if the meta failed at some point, then players can start the meta again (if it's not suppose to be up). For example, if a meta failed, someone could start it and get the loot, then it could start again soon via its global timer. Though, each meta does require a sizeable amount of people to join to complete.

			<br>
			There are 6 hearts, but I recommend doing/repeating 2 of them. Most of the hearts in this map take extremely long to complete and are filled with tedious or annoying (White Mantle) mobs. Each heart rewards <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> 3 Jade Shard</span>. 
			<br><br>
			1) Heart at [&BJUJAAA=]
			<br>
			There are many methods to complete this heart and each take little time to complete. I would first clear any fires with a water bucket. Water can be found along the side of the walls. Simply use the water next to the fire. 
			<br><br>
			Next I would take rations nearby and give them to any NPC labeled "Hungry...". They are throughout the whole side area of this heart from the waypoint to the south edge.

				<img class = "map-image" style = "width: 49%;" src = "../images/lake-doric/heart-2.jpg">
			</div>
			
			Lastly, there are two training areas to the south. One for attacking (sword) and one for defending (shield). For the sword training, wait til the NPC stands upright to use your #1 skill. For the shield training, the NPC will knockdown 2 NPCs before attacking you. That will be your cue to prep and use your #1 skill.

			2) Heart at [&BLQJAAA=]
			<br>
			To the north of the waypoint, there are apple trees. Interact with them and give the apples to "Starving Seraph Soldier" throughout the area. If there's still progress needed for the heart, you can keep interacting with the trees to kill spiders.

			<br> <div class = "paragraph-block"> &#8618; The easiest way to get here is to start at [&BM0JAAA=], take the thermal north of the waypoint, take the next thermal nearby, and head to the area displayed in the picture below. There is a cave surrounded by Devourers and a trail of Unbound Magic orbs leading to it. Once in the cave, take a sharp left and you'll see the champion. If the champion is not up, the Zinn's Stash is located at the top of a pile of rocks looking super shiny. </div>

			<br>

			There are 4 hearts. All of them are quite easy, but can be a little tedious. I recommend doing/repeating all of them. Each heart grants <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> 3 Fire Orchid Blossoms</span>. 
			<br><br>
			1) Heart at [&BNAJAAA=]
			<br>
			Many small tasks can be done for this. The easiest is to save Vigil Recruits trapped in vines, then killing Angered Nature Spirits, and interacting with Suspious Bushes. You could also kill any other mobs around the area.

				<img class = "map-image" style = "width: 70%;" src = "../images/draconis-mons/heart-1.jpg">
			</div>
			
			2) Heart at [&BM0JAAA=]
			<br>
			The easiest method is to simply kill mobs. There are mobs all over north of the waypoint and at [&BMsJAAA=]. The most concentrated area is at [&BMcJAAA=] where there are lots of mobs and caged prisoners. 
			<div class = "map-image-box" style = "display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
				<img class = "map-image" style = "width: 70%;" src = "../images/draconis-mons/heart-2.jpg">
			</div>

			3) Heart at [&BNUJAAA=]
			<br>
			You could either kill spiders, kill egg sacs, interact with mushrooms, and distribute the golem parts to the inactive golems. 
			<div class = "map-image-box" style = "display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">

			</div>

			4) Heart at [&BLwJAAA=]
			<br>
			There are a lot of Inquests to kill. Sometimes they drop an "Inquest Keypad" which you can grab and insert it in a terminal to remove the lazer beams (red spots) and get more credit for the heart.

			<br> <div class = "paragraph-block"> &#8618; There are two events. The first event is a Veteran Illusionary Beast that is located at [&BOEJAAA=]. This is a very annoying event to complete.

			<br>

			There are 5 hearts. All of them are extremely easy and quick. Each rewards <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> 3 Orrian Pearls</span>. After completing all the hearts, you are able to access a secret room at [&BOMJAAA=]. In this room, there's a set of chests. Pick one to get a chance to get more Pearls..or a lot more Pearls (0-51). You may open another for 1g and 50s.

			1) Heart at [&BO0JAAA=]
			<br>
			The quickest to complete this heart is to gather a bunch of mobs, kill a Ley-Line Scavenger. After killing the Scavenger, interact with it and use the #3 skill on the dead undead bodies. 
			<div class = "map-image-box" style = "display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">

			</div>
			
			2) Heart at [&BOAJAAA=] (SE)
			<br>
			As with 1), this can be done the exact same way. Kill mobs, scavenger, interact with the scavenger, then use the #3 skill on the dead undead bodies. 

			<br><br>
			3) Heart at [&BOgJAAA=]
			<br>
			First grab a Artifacts of Dwayna, then glide or mount into the poison clouds. You only need to grab a few to get full credit. 
			<div class = "map-image-box" style = "display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">

				<img class = "map-image" style = "width: 50%;" src = "../images/sirens-landing/heart-4.jpg">
			</div>

			4) Heart at [&BO4JAAA=]
			<br>
			Kill a scavenger, then interact with it, and press the #4 skill near an unlit shrine. The further you channel the skill, the more credit you'll earn for the heart. 
			<div class = "map-image-box" style = "display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
				<img class = "map-image" style = "width: 50%;" src = "../images/sirens-landing/heart-5.jpg">
			</div>

			5) Heart at [&BOEJAAA=]
			<br>
			Same as 4), kill a scavenger, then interact with it, and press the #4 skill near an unlit shrine. The further you channel the skill, the more credit you'll earn for the heart.

			<br>
			There are lots of nodes and caches throughout the map. The nodes themselves guaranteed 1 Orrian Pearl, but cannot be gathered again (with Glyph of Bounty for example). The caches also have a chance to not give a pearl, but have a chance to get 2.
