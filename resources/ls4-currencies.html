					<br> Once per day, you can enter a home instance (preferably that has most/all nodes) to guarantee the currencies. Most nodes offer 3 while some offer a little bit more. If you have the Season 4 Expedition Contract for your home instance, you can get a couple more currencies per day.

There is no limit to the amount of conversions. To obtain a large quantity of Eternal Ice Shards, it is recommended to join LFG or guild Strike Mission runs.

			<br>
			There are 3 hearts to the map, but I recommend doing/repeating only 1: Astralarium at [&BPoKAAA=]. The other two hearts take a long time to process, even with events to help. Is it worthy to note that this map is unique in that each heart rewards <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> 25 Kralkatite Ore </span>.
			<br><br>
			To quickly finish the Astralarium Heart in a minute, focus on interacting with Obelisk Engravings (8) and Telescopic Mirrors (8) and killing any nearby enemies (Orthodox Scholar, Awakened). From the waypoint, run around the area. Telescopic mirrios are 1 floor below.

			<br>
			Every 15 minutes, there's a Branded meteor that crash lands. These meteors can offer players with a couple Kralkatite Ore, Powdered Rose Quartz, and Rose Quartz. You need to obtain the <a href = "https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Brandstone_Multitool" target = "_blank" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> Brandstone Multitool</a> in order to gather the materials. 
			<br><br>
			If the meteor lands at the Plains of Jarin [&BBcLAAA=], then there's a quick event. Do not destroy the meteor, instead, use skill 5 of the tool at the location to mark it on the map. Then, use skill 3 to harvest it. (Left picture)
			<br><br>
			If the meteor lands anywhere else, then use skill 5 at the location to mark it on the map. If 5 players mark it, then it will increase the rewards. (Right picture)

			<br>
			In total, there are 4 hearts, but I recommend doing/repeating 3 of them. Each of these hearts grant <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> 5 Difluorite Crystals </span> and are fairly quick to complete. 
			<br><br>
			1) Heart at [&BDYLAAA=]
			<br>
			To complete this heart quickly, simply use your Springer mount to stomp on mounds and kill Scarabs around. There are two locations where they are plentiful. 
			<br>

			<br>
			2) Heart at [&BCULAAA=] 
			<br>
			There are many small tasks to complete this quickly. Gather flowers and turn them in to the NPC, kill Inquests, and take Power Cores to Inactive Golems. All of these are all around the heart. 
			<br><br>
			3) Heart at [&BC0LAAA=]
			<br>
			While there is an event that can easily complete this heart, the much faster way is to hop down in the lab and destroy mobs. Only a few will complete the heart.

			Caches are called "Sunken Chests" and only spawn after completing the Gathering Storms meta. These chests will spawn throughout the shore or near it. There's not a guaranteed that there will be a Difluorite Crystal, but there's a chance. The picture below are the possible locations.

			<br><br>
			1) Heart at [&BFcLAAA=]
			<br>
			To complete this heart quickly, there is an event that is frequently ready to be up. It is north of the waypoint with the NPC named "Researcher Siris". This event alone will complete the heart by killing Inquest. If the event is not ready, it may be best to skip until it is as the other methods take a bit.

			</div>
			
			2) Heart at [&BFALAAA=]
			<br>
			Generally, there is an event where you attack choyas. This event is long, but it does finish the heart very quickly. Do the event until the heart progress has filled. Otherwise, if the pre-meta or one of the cannon attack events are up, it also completes the heart quickly.
			<div class = "map-image-box" style = "display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">

			3) Heart at [&BFcLAAA=]
			<br>
			There are two ways to complete this heart quick. You could either destroy any Awakened or Scarab plague (jump or mount over the blob) or get Corsair supplies to cannons. The picture below shows the location of the supplies and the cannons. 
			<div class = "map-image-box" style = "display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">

			<br>

			Unlike other maps, there are no nodes for Inscribed Shards. They come in two forms of caches: Kournan Supply Cache and Kournan Cache. Both will offer <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> 1 guaranteed Inscribed Shard </span>.

			2) Heart at [&BIMLAAA=]
			<br>
			There are two very fast and easy ways to complete this heart. The first to grab Branded Shards located at Test Dummy sites and throw them at the dummies. The other way is to interact with inactive DERV golems and give them the necessary parts.

			Compared to other LS4 maps, there are rarely any nodes around. Though, there are many Mist-Touched Cache that grants <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> 1 guaranteed Mistonium </span>. Both the nodes and caches are very spread out and in not-so-obvious places.

			There are 2 metas to this map. These are unique that after completing, there will be more nodes that spawn. Thunderhead Keep meta spawns around 5 more nodes while the Oil Floes meta spawns 3.

			<br>

			There are 4 hearts. All of them are quite easy and quick to complete. I recommend doing/repeating all of them. Each heart grants <span style = "font-weight: bold;"> 5 Branded Masses</span>. 
			<br><br>
			1) Heart at [&BMQLAAA=]
			<br>
			There are NPCs with a sad face icon above their head. Use your special skill to make them happy again. It's best to start with single NPCs until the bar above your head reaches full. Then you can interact with the crowded sad peeps. 
			<div class = "map-image-box" style = "display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
				<img class = "map-image" style = "width: 49%;" src = "../images/thunderhead-peaks/heart-1.jpg">
			</div>
			<br><br>
			2) Heart at [&BLsLAAA=]
			<br>
			There are two methods to do this heart. You could grab a scanner gun near the heart NPC. By using the gun, you will have a special skill. Use skill #1 on Dig Sites. If the object shows a yellow item, use skill #3. If the object shows a green item, use skill #2. 
			<br><br>
			The other method is to go a little SE from the heart vendor to a pit. There is an activity where a player must go into a white circle to catch supply. Once caught, turn in the supply to the appropiate pin (hover your #1 skill to see what it says). To stop the skritt from catching it, simply interact with it to stun him.

				<img class = "map-image" style = "width: 49%;" src = "../images/thunderhead-peaks/heart-3.jpg">
			</div>
			2) Heart at [&BLoLAAA=]
			<br>
			The fastest way seems to be to kill yellow enemies named, "Angery ...". These mobs are spread around the heart. 
			<br><br>
			3) Heart at [&BKYLAAA=]
			<br>
			Go around the area and above the structures to find "Discouraged Dredge Excavators". Here are the list of good responses to each Dredge: 
			<br> "You'll go on knowing you did all that could. For your people."
			<br><br> "And if he were here now, he would thank you. You did the right thing."
			<br><br> "The Brand had already taken them. You gave them peace. Don't forget that."

			There are a lot of Dragon Crystal nodes around the outside section of the map.

			<br>
			Unlike the last 5 maps, this map does not have hearts and all events are tied to a single meta. To effectively farm Mistborn Motes, it is highly recommended to do the meta. Find a train in LFG as it does take a while and needs a good amount of people.

			<br>
			There are not a lot of nodes around the map. It's probably best to gather them while doing events.

			<br><br>
			Note: There are 6 guaranteed nodes that spawn after defeat the meta (during champ train). Locations are <a href = "../maps/dragonfall.html#post-meta-mistborn-mote" target = "_blank" style = "text-decoration: underline;"> here</a>.
